# Next Action

**1. Owner editorial review: the owner only.**
- Daniel is complete in research, cross-book validation, technical validation and deployment.
- Only the owner's decisions remain: **157 Daniel-related open review items**, plus 1 Amos item.
- Work through `docs/reviews/DANIEL_OWNER_REVIEW_PACKAGE.md`. Each item gives its evidence, research state and an advisory recommendation.
- Decide with `pnpm review:approve <rev_id>`, `pnpm review:reject <rev_id>` or `pnpm review:return <rev_id>`.
- **Claude must never run approve or reject.**
- Returned items come back to Claude as research tasks.

**2. Milestone 7: full canon expansion** (SPEC Part 20).
- The owner review need not block it, but publication levels stay at *researched* until the reviews are decided.
- Prioritise books whose historical contexts overlap the existing records, to strengthen entity resolution and chronology. Suggested order:
  1. **2 Kings 22–23 and 2 Chronicles 34–35:** Josiah; Megiddo in 609, linked to the Necho record; Carchemish background.
  2. **Ezra 2–6 and Haggai–Zechariah 1–8:** the return and the Temple's rebuilding, using the existing Darius I decree and the 516/515 completion.
  3. **Nehemiah 1–2 and Ezra 7:** the Artaxerxes decrees already exist as events; complete their chapters.
  4. **Esther:** Xerxes I (P&D reigns).
  5. **Jeremiah 26–45 and Ezekiel 1, 24, 33, 40:** Ezekiel's dated oracles against the 586/587 models.
  6. **The rest of the canon,** in the order of SPEC Part 20.
- Start with `pnpm research:chapter 2-kings 22`. Then validate, audit, export, build and run e2e; open a PR per unit, merge after CI, and verify the deployed site.

**Carried-over gaps** (see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, "Daniel completion state"): sources that are blocked or unavailable, and the engine's Nisan-window limitation for Nehemiah 2.
